            <h2>Understanding Nationality Bias in Sports</h2>
            <p>Nationality bias in sports refers to the tendency to favor athletes or teams from one's own country or to discriminate against those from other nations. This bias can manifest in various ways, from judging and officiating to media coverage and fan behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aspects of Nationality Bias in Sports:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Judging Bias:</strong> Studies have shown that judges may favor athletes from their home country in competitions like figure skating and ski jumping.</li>
                <li><strong>Officiating Decisions:</strong> Research indicates that referees may exhibit bias towards players from their own country in football (soccer) matches.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> Athletes from certain countries may receive disproportionate media attention compared to equally skilled competitors from other nations.</li>
                <li><strong>Fan Behavior:</strong> Intense patriotism can lead to biased support and sometimes hostile behavior towards athletes or teams from other countries.</li>
            </ul>
