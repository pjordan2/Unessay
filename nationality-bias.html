            <h2>Understanding Nationality Bias in Sports</h2>
            <p>Nationality bias in sports refers to the phenomenon of favoring athletes or teams from one's own country or to discriminate against athletes from other nations. For example, judges may 
                unconsciously score athletes from their own nation more favorably than competitors from other countries, leading to unfair advantages in scoring systems in competitions such as the 
                Olympics. The phenomenon of a "home-field advantage" also plays a role in nationality bias. Athletes competing in their home country often receive increased support from local fans and judges 
                who may be more lenient towards them compared to foreign competitors. This can create an uneven playing field where success is influenced more by nationality than by actual performance or talent.
                The influence of nationality bias is specifically concerning since they undermine the integrity of international competitions. When results are perceived as biased, it can decrease 
                public trust in the fairness of sports organizations and competitions, ultimately affecting athlete morale and causing them to pull out participation in future events.</p>
