            <h2>Understanding Gender Bias in Sports</h2>
            <p>Gender bias in sports has been a persistent issue from the very beginning, affecting various aspects such as participation rates, funding, media coverage, and pay equity. Historically, 
                women have faced significant barriers in accessing sports opportunities and recognition with gender bias remaining one of the most visible forms of discrimination in sports today. 
                Despite progress being made since the introduction of Title IX in 1972, which aims to provide equal opportunities for women in sports, significant disparities persist on today.
                For starters, women's sports frequently suffer from a lack of visibility; events are often scheduled at less favorable times compared to men's events or are simply just not shown at all, 
                leading to reduced audience engagement and sponsorship opportunities. This is an issue that's currently being fought as we see figures like Dawn Staley, Caitlyn Clark, Angel Reese, etc.
                changing the game for women's college basketball, making it more popular among sports fans, yet still barely any outlet to actually watch these games, despite three games involving the
                Iowa team from the 2024 March Madness tournament, breaking the record for the most watched basketball game at any level. </p>

            <p>Sexism also manifests through media portrayals where female athletes are often judged based on their appearance rather than their athletic achievements or skills. Degrading comments 
                made by commentators during women's events further illustrate this bias and contribute to a culture that devalues women's contributions to sports. Which not only affects public 
                perception but also impacts young girls' aspirations to pursue athletics seriously as this sends the message that no matter how good you are or what you accomplish, you're still
                only going to be judged and perceived based on your looks. This isn't just an issue when it comes to players, women sports commentators also still have to deal with criticism simply
                because they're a woman in a male dominated field. Though on the rise, there still aren't a lot of women commentators in the sports world, especially professionally, so to see one is
                definitely special. But when you also have people saying "I don't want to turn my tv and see three women trying to talk about football" it makes it hard for them to want to do the thing
                they love. Women have constantly had to deal with hearing things like "You don't know anything about sports, stay in a girls place" or "Sports are for men" and just overall constantly
                have their interest or knowledge in sports degraded by men, so to finally believe society has come to a point that accepts you in the sports world and yet still have your work criticized
                or told you don't know what you're talking about simply because of your gender, doesn't feel good and would make you second guess doing what you love.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Aspects of Gender Bias in Sports:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Women have historically had lower participation rates in organized sports.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> Female athletes and women's sports often receive less media attention when it comes to television, radio time, articles, etc., 
                    compared to their male counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Funding and Pay Equity:</strong> There are major disparities in funding between men's and women's sports programs at various levels including how much funding women's 
                    college programs are supported with or even how much women professional athletes are paid. This is a big issue that women all over have been advocating to fix with the latest 
                    progress made being the U.S. women's national soccer team winning their fight for equal pay in the World Cup by combining how much they and the men's team make and splitting that 
                    in half.</li>
