            <h2>Biases in Sports</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, sports have been a reflection of society, including its biases and prejudices. We view sports now as a way to bring a nation together and celebrate our patriotism 
                but it wasn't always that way. This website explores three major types of bias in sports: gender bias, racial bias, and nationality bias. While these three are big problems in sports 
                by themselves, some athletes face a combination of these biases. Women sports have been a huge debate in the sports world for a long time, with many people believing they don't belong
                in sports or they aren't as talented or entertaining as men in sports. Racial bias has been a huge problem in the sports world as well, with many athletes being discriminated against 
                and constantly having to prove themselves way more than their white counterparts. Now just think about the athletes who have to face both of these. Being a non-white woman athlete is 
                a constant challenge and struggle of people saying you don't belong, you shouldn't be playing, you're not good enough, and so much more. While the sports world has fully welcomed the 
                non-white male athletes and even the white woman athletes, this is an issue that these women still face to this day and have to persevere through while playing the game they love. 
                Take for example Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese. Throughout her time in college she faced constant abuse and criticism from "fans" for simply being who she is while playing fantastically, 
                meanwhile her white counterpart, Caitlyn Clark, received nothing but praise for doing the exact same thing. It isn't fair that Reese had to constantly prove herself over and over 
                again while people still berate her and tell her constantly that she shouldn't be playing or to focus on school or that she'll never make it while Clark or even African American male 
                athletes do the same thing and receive praise for it.</p>

            <p>Each page provides detailed information and informative charts to illustrate the prevalence and impact of these biases over time including why they're important and how they
                might affect these athletes.</p>
